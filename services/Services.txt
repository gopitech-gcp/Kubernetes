Service types
Kubernetes has several types of Services for different use cases and requirements. The major ones are:

ClusterIP
NodePort
LoadBalancer

ClusterIP: ClusterIP is the most basic and provides a reliable endpoint (name, IP, and port) on the internal Pod network. 
---
Nodeport : NodePort Services build on top of ClusterIP and allow external clients to connect via a port on every cluster node.
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: skippy           <<==== Registered with the internal cluster DNS (ClusterIP)
    spec:
      type: NodePort         <<==== Service type
      ports:
      - port: 8080           <<==== ClusterIP port
        targetPort: 9000     <<==== Application port in container
        nodePort: 30050      <<==== External port on every cluster node (NodePort)
      selector:
        app: hello-world
---        
Load Balance: LoadBalancers build on top of both and integrate with cloud load balancers for extremely simple access from the internet.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: lb               <<==== Registered with cluster DNS
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 8080           <<==== Load balancer port
    targetPort: 9000     <<==== Application port inside container
  selector:
    project: tkb
