Service	: A NodePort service is created, exposing a static port on all cluster nodes for external access.
Pod/Deployment: The service forwards traffic to the pods that match the selector of the service.
Firewall Rules	: Google Cloud configures firewall rules to allow access to the NodePort range (30000â€“32767) for external traffic.
Load Balancing	: The service load balances traffic to all matching pods, but is simpler compared to external load balancers.
