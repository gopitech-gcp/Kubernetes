Pod : 
  Atomic unit or smallest “unit of work”of Kubernetes.
● Pods are one or MORE containers that share volumes, a network namespace, and are a part of a single context


#The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing a single instance of a running process in your 
cluster.
 Purpose: Groups one or more containers (e.g., Docker 
containers) that share the same network namespace and 
storage volumes.
 Key Features:
o Containers in a pod share the same IP address and port 
space.
o Pods are ephemeral; when a pod is deleted, a new pod may 
be created with a different IP.
 Example –
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata:
  name: my-pod 
spec:
  containers:
- name: my-container 
  image: nginx
